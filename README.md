# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

This is my solution to the [Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). It's a great beginner-friendly project to practice semantic HTML, custom CSS variables, and responsive design.
